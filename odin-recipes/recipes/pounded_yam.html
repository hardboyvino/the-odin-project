    <h2>What is Pounded Yam?</h2>
    <p>Pounded yam is staple in many Nigerian homes, especially the Yoruba tribe. Pounded yam cannot be eaten by itself and is often paired with many delicious soups, and stews such as egusi, okra soup, ewedu or efo riro</p>
    <p>Pounded yam is mashed boiled yam served in ball shapes wraped (purely for aesthetics) and eaten in morsels.</p>
    <p>We cut out a morsel from the meal,  then we form an indentation on it with the thumb. Then, we scoop some stew or soup over it and we eat it.</p>
    <p>Often time it’s swallowed, but sometimes it requires a bit of chewing depending on the type of stew or soup you choose to pair it with. Other food in the swallow group includes fufu – made from cassava or cassava flour, Eba, Amala, and more.</p>
